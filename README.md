## Description

React Colors is a simple application that provides users a simple interface to create beautiful color palettes. After creating the original color palette of 20 colors, it allows users to try out different shades of the some color. This allows the user to easily test new colors and see which ones fit nicely into the palette. Once the color palette is made, the user can copy the color codes to use for their project. React Colors also comes with the functionality to change the color format to Hex, RGB, and RGBA to adjust to the users needs. Altogether, React Colors is an easy-to-use color picker that is user friendly and can be used with any project to create nice-looking color combinations.

## Reflection

React Colors was a 6 week long project that I build to apply my react skills that I learned from doing a Udemy course online. The goal of the project was to use technologies learned from the course, and create a fully functioning application.


The project led me through the process of taking a simple idea, and turning it into an app. At first, I struggled to find a starting point from which to start building my application, however, I learned how to take a complex idea and break it up into little pieces. This way, I could focus on implementing one feature at a time, while also not get overwhelmed by the scale of the project.


Throughout the creation process, I learned how to find new technologies to fit my needs and use the provided documentation to understand and use the technology. For example, when using Material-UI or Chroma JS, two technologies I had never used before, I learned how to navigate the documentation to find what I need and implement it into my application.


In the beginning, I started the process by using the create-react-app boilerplate and then adding react-router-5.2. One of the main challenges I ran into was during the end of the creation process. Due to there being many files and complex logic connected between various files, I was constantly lost and it became harder to add new logic without breaking the application. Here, I learned new techniques to troubleshoot to understand how all the files are connected. This way, it became easier for me to implement new features when the size of the application grew.


React Colors is also the first application I used with git and github. I learned how to use git and github and the importance of commiting after adding each new feature. When troubleshooting or adding new features, there were multiple instances where I had to revert back to older commits or use rebase to delete commits. This allowed me more freedom when testing out new features because even if I made mistakes, I could reset my application back to an older version.


At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 5.2, Emoji-Mart, Chroma Js, Material-UI, React-Sortable-HOC, React-Transition-Group and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, JSS, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on handrolling a webpack.config.js file to more fully understand the build process.
